# JuliaCon2018Notebooks
Updated version of the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks (`demo_type.ipynb` and `demo_exch.ipynb`) that were used to introduce the `MeshArrays.jl` package in [this JuliaCon-2018 presentation](https://youtu.be/RDxAy_zSUvg) + another notebook one showing how the `smooth` function is used in the CI testing of the [MeshArrays.jl package](https://github.com/gaelforget/MeshArrays.jl) (`demo_smooth.ipynb`).
