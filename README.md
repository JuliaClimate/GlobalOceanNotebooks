# JuliaCon2018Notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gaelforget/JuliaCon2018Notebooks/master)

This [JuliaCon-2018 presentation](https://youtu.be/RDxAy_zSUvg) relied on two `Jupyter` notebooks provided here (`demo_type.ipynb` and `demo_exch.ipynb`) and predefined grids (downloaded from `github` within the notebooks).

## Added notebooks:

`demo_smooth.ipynb` illustrates how `MeshArrays.smooth` is used for unit testing the [MeshArrays.jl package](https://github.com/gaelforget/MeshArrays.jl). This notebook does not require downloading any of the predefined grids.

## Activate notebooks:

An interactive version can readily be spun up via the `launch binder` badge.
